### Project Title
Udacity Bikeshare Project Github Simulation.

### Description
In this project, I simulate version control system called git on a bikeshare project I completed earlier. 
In the bikeshare project, I use data provided by Motivate, to create an interactive shell application that allows user to provide input and get information about bike share usage patterns
I also compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
### Files used

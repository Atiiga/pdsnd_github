### Project Title
Bikeshare Project Github Simulation.

### Description
In this project, I simulate version control system called git on a bikeshare project I completed earlier. 
In the bikeshare project, I use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 
I also compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
### Files used
bikeshare.py
chicago.csv
ney_york_city.csv
washington.csv
